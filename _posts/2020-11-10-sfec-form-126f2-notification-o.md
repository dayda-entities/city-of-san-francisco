Each City agency seeking to enter into a contract that has a total anticipated or actual value of $100,000 or more must file this form with the Ethics Commission within 30 days of the submission of a proposal.  For more information, see: https://sfethics.org/compliance/city-officers/city-contracts/city-departments

The Named Parties dataset (https://data.sfgov.org/d/djj2-gvaq/) must be joined with the parent dataset (https://data.sfgov.org/d/pv99-gzft) using the DocuSignID to connect contractors and subcontractors to the proposals.
