This data set pertains to all types of structural permits. Data includes details on application/permit numbers, job addresses, supervisorial districts, and the current status of the applications. Data is uploaded weekly by DBI. Users can access permit information online through DBIâ€™s Permit Tracking System which is 24/7 at www.sfdbi.org/dbipts.

Note if you need to open permits in Excel, use one of the pre-filtered datasets:

1. Building Permits on or after January 1, 2013 https://data.sfgov.org/d/p4e4-a5a7
2. Building Permits before January 1, 2013 https://data.sfgov.org/d/4jpb-z4kk
