<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>
This dataset represents the COVID-19 positive confirmed cases by age group. Demographic and transmission data are based on information reported from case interviews, laboratories, and providers. This data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases and data will change to reflect as information becomes available. Cumulative counts of 5 or fewer are excluded from the dataset.

<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>
Information on cases and deaths including case demographic and transmission details is reported from a combination of data sources including electronic and faxed laboratory reports, case interviews, medical providers, and electronic medical record systems. These multiple streams of data are merged, deduplicated, undergo quality assurance and other data verification processes, and are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco residents with COVID-19. Data are prepared by close of business daily for public display.

<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>
Updated daily, dataset uploaded manually by staff

<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>
Age groups are binned in to the following groups to minimize re-identifcation:
<18, 18-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, 81+, Unknown

Unknowns may become known over time as more information is gathered.

age groups resulting in 5 or fewer cumulative cases are dropped for privacy reasons.
