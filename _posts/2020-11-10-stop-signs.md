A. SUMMARY Stop signs located at each intersection node.

B. METHODOLOGY  Stop sign legislation information is taken from MTAB legislation. Stop sign implementation information is taken from SSD Shops Reports and then parsed via python code. Implementation for stop signs will specify where signs are installed or removed, and the work order that the sign installation/removal was spec'd in.
