These are complaints from Housing, Building, Electrical, Plumbing, and Code Enforcement divisions within the Department of Building Inspection. Routine and non-routine inspections from the housing division are tracked using complaints only if violations are found during the inspections. The NOVTYPE field can be used to determine the source of the complaint.
