Construction work at a building site is controlled and scheduled through the permit process by the submission and approval of a series of segmented phased construction plans identified as addenda. Addenda are routed and approved at a set of stations that vary based on the content of the plans being submitted for approval. The number of addenda submitted per permit will vary based on the type and complexity of the project. This dataset contains a row for each step for one or many addenda associated with a permit application. These records can be tied to the building permit dataset at https://data.sfgov.org/d/i98e-djp9 by application number.
