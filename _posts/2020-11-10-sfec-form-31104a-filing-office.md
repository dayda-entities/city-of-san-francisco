The Ethics Commission shall maintain on its website, a database of the names, departments, and positions of persons who are required to file any statement required by Sections 3.1-101, 3.1-102, and 3.1-103 of the Campaign and Governmental Conduct Code (Form 700 Statements of Economic Interests, Sunshine Ordinance Declarations, and Certificates of Ethics Training) but have failed to file on a timely basis. The list shall be updated no later than ten days after the submittal of a statement. On or before April 10th of each year, the Ethics Commission shall notify each Commission Secretary, or any City staff who fulfills that role for each City board or commission, of the location of the current version of this list.
