<strong>Annual Inventory Update Notice</strong>
We have updated the inventory with provisional update as of July 1, 2020 based on an initial cleanup and reconciliation of records. DataSF staff are delayed on a full update because of the ongoing COVID-19 response but are working with departments to complete that annual update by end of July.

<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>
In compliance with CA Government Code 6270.5 (passed via SB 272), the City must publish a catalog of enterprise systems that collect data about the public. There are certain exceptions to this detailed in the Government Code. The code is available here: http://bit.ly/CAinventory

<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>
This dataset is collated through 2 ways:
1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new or retired systems, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling records at the request of departments
2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates

<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>
The dataset changes infrequently and is uploaded manually as needed by DataSF staff

<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>
<em>Companion dataset inventory dataset</em>
A companion <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Dataset-inventory/y8fp-fbf5">dataset of inventoried and published datasets can be accessed online</a> as well.
