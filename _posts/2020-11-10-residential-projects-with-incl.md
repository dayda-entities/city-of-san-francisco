Subject to Planning Code Section 415 (http://bit.ly/1ag0AmP), developments of 10 or more units fall under the City's Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program. Data on residential projects are collected through the lifecycle of the projects by the Planning Department and the Department of Building Inspection. On a quarterly basis, the Mayor's Office of Housing and Community Development works with Planning to produce a list for tracking and monitoring of these projects.
