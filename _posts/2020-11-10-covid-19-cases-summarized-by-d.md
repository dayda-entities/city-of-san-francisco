<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>
This dataset represents the COVID-19 positive confirmed cases and deaths by day and transmission type. Demographic and transmission data are based on information reported from case interviews, laboratories, and providers. This data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases and data will change to reflect as information becomes available. 

<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>
Information on cases and deaths including case demographic and transmission details is reported from a combination of data sources including electronic and faxed laboratory reports, case interviews, medical providers, and electronic medical record systems. These multiple streams of data are merged, deduplicated, undergo quality assurance and other data verification processes, and are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco residents with COVID-19.

<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>
Updated daily, dataset uploaded manually by staff

<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>
Case counts are provided by category of the disposition. Confirmed are those cases where lab testing was positive, deaths are those cases of infection resulting in death. To get counts in either category, you must filter the Case Type Disposition or pivot the data.

Information on transmission of COVID-19 is based on case interviews with individuals who have a confirmed positive test. Individuals are asked if they have been in close contact with a known COVID-19 case. If they answer yes, transmission category is recorded as contact with a known case.  If they report no contact with a known case, transmission category is recorded as community transmission.  If the case is not interviewed or was not asked the question, they are counted as unknown.

These data do not reflect the number of COVID-19 recoveries. The San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) is focused on caring for patients, reducing the spread of COVID-19, and tracking the surge. Recoveries happen in many settings, including homes, residential facilities, and hospitals, and are not routinely reported to the local health department. This is consistent with SFDPH reporting in the regular flu season.

There are three other datasets related to cases:
