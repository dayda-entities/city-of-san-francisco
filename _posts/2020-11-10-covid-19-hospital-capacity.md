<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>
Data on daily hospital bed use and available capacity at San Francisco acute care hospitals from April 2020 onward. Long Term Care facilities (like Laguna Honda and Kentfield) are not included in this data as acute care patients cannot be admitted to these facilities.
<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>
This hospital capacity information is based on data that all SF acute care hospitals report to the San Francisco Department of Public Health.
<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>
Updated daily, dataset uploaded manually by staff. This data is on a 2-day lag to account for the time needed to get complete data from all SF acute care hospitals and validate this data.
<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>
This data provides visibility into current occupancy levels and use of San Francisco acute care hospitals and potential ability to accommodate anticipated surges of COVID patients. 
Data includes current census of COVID-19 patients (including both confirmed cases and suspected COVID patients) and other patients in acute care hospitals, shown in the “Status” column. The “Status” column also includes all available beds.
This daily census information is stratified by type of bed (acute care, intensive care, and surge) in the “Bed Type” column. Acute care beds treat patients with illnesses and injuries including recovery from surgeries. Intensive care (ICU) beds are for sicker patients in need of critical and life support services that can include the use of a ventilator. Surge beds are the additional beds that can be made available to handle an influx of COVID-19 patients; surge beds are differentiated between acute care surge beds and ICU surge beds.
Note: The current census of COVID patients shown here may not always match the hospitalizations data (https://data.sfgov.org/COVID-19/COVID-19-Hospitalizations/nxjg-bhem), as that data includes all hospitals and long term care facilities. As described above, those long term care facilities are not included here as they don’t have the capacity to take in additional acute care patients and therefore aren’t included in capacity measures.
