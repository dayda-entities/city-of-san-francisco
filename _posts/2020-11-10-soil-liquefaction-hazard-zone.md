Map delineation of the different types and ages of Quaternary deposits supports evaluation of susceptibility to liquefaction. These areas can be expected to experience increased damage from ground shaking during an earthquake. The dataset displays where high and very high liquefaction hazard areas are found. This was used for the 2019 HCR update process.
