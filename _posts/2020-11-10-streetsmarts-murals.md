<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>
StreetSmARTS is a Department of Public Works (DPW) graffiti abatement program, administered through the San Francisco Arts Commission (SFAC). The program connects artists with private property owners to create murals on their buildings, enhancing the character of the property and surrounding neighborhood, while deterring ongoing vandalism.

<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>
In 2017, an inventory was compiled manually by staff and it has been updated with each new mural created since.

<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>
Dataset updated as needed manually by staff.

<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>
The majority of murals have street addresses but a few have street intersections instead. The address is the building location but the mural may be on the side of the building or around the corner. The data column "number_of_districts" refers to how many Cultural Districts a mural is in. If a mural is in more than Cultural Districts, the districts will be listed in the "Cultural_District" column and separated by a semicolon. This is because cultural districts can overlap. 

The <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Cultural-Heritage-Districts/5xmc-5bjj">cultural heritage districts dataset is also available online</a>.
