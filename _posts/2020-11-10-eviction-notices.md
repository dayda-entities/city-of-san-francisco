Data includes eviction notices filed with the San Francisco Rent Board per San Francisco Administrative Code 37.9(c). A notice of eviction does not necessarily indicate that the tenant was eventually evicted, so the notices below may differ from actual evictions. Notices are published since January 1, 1997.
