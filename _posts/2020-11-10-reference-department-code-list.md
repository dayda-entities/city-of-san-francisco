These department codes are maintained in the City's financial system of record. Department Groups, Divisions, Sections, Units, Sub Units and Departments are nested in the dataset from left to right. Each nested unit has both a code and an associated name. 

The dataset represents a flattened tree (hierarchy) so that each leaf on the tree has it's own row. Thus certain rows will have repeated codes across columns.

Data changes as needed.
