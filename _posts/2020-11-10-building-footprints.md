These footprint extents are collapsed from an earlier 3D building model provided by Pictometry of 2010, and have been refined from a version of building masses publicly available on the open data portal for over two years.The building masses were manually split with reference to parcel lines, but using vertices from the building mass wherever possible.These split footprints correspond closely to individual structures even where there are common walls; the goal of the splitting process was to divide the building mass wherever there was likely to be a firewall.
An arbitrary identifier was assigned based on a descending sort of building area for 177,023 footprints. The centroid of each footprint was used to join a property identifier from a draft of the San Francisco Enterprise GIS Program's cartographic base, which provides continuous coverage with distinct right-of-way areas as well as selected nearby parcels from adjacent counties. See accompanying document SF_BldgFoot_2017-05_description.pdf for more on methodology and motivation
