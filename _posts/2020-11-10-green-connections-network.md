Green Connections aims to increase access to parks, open spaces, and the waterfront by envisioning a network of green connectors -- city streets that will be upgraded incrementally over the next 20 years to make it safer and more pleasant to travel to parks by walking, biking, and other forms of active transportation. The dataset is a zipped GIS shapefile of the Green Connections Network which is shown in this map: http://www.sf-planning.org/ftp/files/Citywide/green_connections/GC_Final_Network_Map_03-2014.pdf.  Further information can be found on the Green Connections website: http://greenconnections.sfplanning.org
