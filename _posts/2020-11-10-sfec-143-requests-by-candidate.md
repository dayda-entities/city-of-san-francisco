SFEC Form 143 is used by any candidate for Mayor or the Board of Supervisors.  Candidates seeking the same office as a candidate identified in a communication may object to the Executive Directorâ€™s determination of whether a communication reported on filings required under section 1.161, 1.162 or 1.163 actually supports or opposes a candidate or is neutral. Such requests must be filed within one business day from the date the Executive Director makes his or her determination. This dataset includes SFEC Form 143 filings as of March 4, 2020.
