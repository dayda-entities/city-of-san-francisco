The San Francisco Controller's Office maintains a database of actual citywide staffing data from fiscal year 2003 forward. This data is presented on the Spending and Revenue report hosted at http://openbook.sfgov.org, and is also available in this dataset in CSV format. New data is added on a weekly basis.
