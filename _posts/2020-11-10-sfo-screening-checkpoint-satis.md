The screening checkpoint experience is a key driver of satisfaction at SFO, thus understanding the quality of the service and controllable experiences is required to improve it. SFO conducted two surveys of the Terminal 2 checkpoint in 2019. One in May, and after improvements were made, another in October to understand whether this changes were successful or in any way impactful.
