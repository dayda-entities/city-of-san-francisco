Data updated 11/13/2020. The Existing Buildings Energy Performance Ordinance (Environment Code Chapter 20) requires that each non-residential building with at least 10,000 square feet of conditioned (heated or cooled) space and each residential building  with at least 50,000 square feet of conditioned space must be benchmarked using Energy Star Portfolio Manager annually. Each non-residential building specified above is also required to undergo an energy audit or retrocommissioning at least once every 5 years. 

More information: www.sfenvironment.org/ebo. This dataset lists compliance status for private-sector (non-municipal) properties where the owner has been notified a building is subject to the ordinance. Fields reported have expanded as of early October 2015 to include energy use intensity, the 1-100 Portfolio Manager rating, and estimated greenhouse gas emissions from annual energy consumption.
