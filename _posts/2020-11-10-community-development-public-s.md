Through the Community Development Public Service Programs, MOHCD funds a wide range of social services, with two primary objectives: 1) Families and individuals are resilient and economically self-sufficient, and 2) Families and individuals are stably housed. These objectives are met through specific funding strategies developed in our ten program areas. This data reports MOHCDâ€™s efforts toward accomplishing those two objectives across each program area. Data reflects activities funded for Fiscal Year 2018-2019 as of June 30, 2019.
