Counts of airline operations that incur noise exceeding threshold by airline and by month. The Aircraft Noise Abatement Office collects this data using an Airport Noise and Operations Management System. It is collected using remote noise monitor sites in the communities surrounding SFO. This data is collected to monitor and grade airlines' performance as part of SFO's Fly Quiet Program.
