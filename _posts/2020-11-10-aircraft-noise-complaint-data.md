Counts of aircraft noise complaints by community and by month.  The Aircraft Noise Abatement Office collects this data via the Complaint Hotline, Online Complaint Form, emails, letters and telephone calls to our office. This information is collected and published in a monthly report which is presented at the SFO Airport Community Roundtable meetings. It is used to understand community's aircraft noise concerns, to collaborate with stakeholders in an effort to reduce and manage aircraft noise.
