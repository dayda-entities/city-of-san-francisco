Land use categories for every parcel in San Francisco. The land use categories are derived from a range of City and commercial databases.  Where building square footages were missing from these databases they were derived from a LIDAR survey flown in 2007.<br><br>Land use categories are as follows (units are square feet):<br>	CIE = Cultural, Institutional, Educational<br>MED = Medical<br>MIPS = Office (Management, Information, Professional Services)<br>MIXED = Mixed Uses (Without Residential)<br>MIXRES = Mixed Uses (With Residential)<br>PDR = Industrial (Production, Distribution, Repair)<br>RETAIL/ENT = Retail, Entertainment<br>RESIDENT = Residential<br>VISITOR = Hotels, Visitor Services<br>VACANT = Vacant<br>ROW = Right-of-Way<br>OPENSPACE = Open Space<br><br>Other attributes are:<br>RESUNITS = Residential Units<br>BLDGSQFT = Square footage data<br>YRBUILT = year built<br>TOTAL_USES = Business points from Dun & Bradstreet were spatially aggregated to the closest parcel, and this field is the sum of the square footage fields<br>The subsequent fields (CIE, MED, MIPS, RETAIL, PDER & VISITOR) were derived using the NAICS codes supplied in the Dun & Bradstreet dataset, and the previous TOTAL_USES column.<br><br>The determining factor for a parcel's LANDUSE is if the square footage of any non-residential use is 80% or more of its total uses.  Otherwise it becomes MIXED.<br><br>In the case where RESIDENT use has some square footage of non-residential use, this is mainly accessory uses such as home businesses, freelancers, etc.
