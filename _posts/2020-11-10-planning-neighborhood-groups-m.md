Neighborhood notification boundaries created by the Department of City Planning. These boundaries are designed solely for the Planning Department's neighborhood notifications where neighborhood groups are notified about certain types of developments in their area. An Excel spreadsheet of Neighborhood Groups contact details can be downloaded from this page: http://sf-planning.org/index.aspx?page=1654 There are alternative neighborhood boundaries available (which include a larger number of neighborhoods) here (Mayors Office): https://data.sfgov.org/d/pty2-tcw4 and here (Realtors): https://data.sfgov.org/d/5gzd-g9ns
