A. SUMMARY This dataset is the data behind the Interactive Project Map (IPM) Collector Tool web map. The IPM web map gathers spatial data for agency projects that have project pages on SFMTA.com and CIP projects.

For more information about this dataset please contact ProjectMap@sfmta.com

B. METHODOLOGY  Data is collected from project managers and SFMTA.com project page editors through the Interactive Project Map Collector Tool.

C. UPDATE FREQUENCY  The data is updated on an as needed basis. Project geographies should be updated by project managers and project pge editors whenever project extents change. 

D. OTHER CRITICAL INFO  Please note there is a 250ft buffer for projects to more accurately represent the supervisor districts and neighborhoods that could potentially be affected by a project.
