Inventory of tall buildings in San Francisco, focusing on attributes that are relevant to building performance during an earthquake or to post-earthquake recovery.

As of October 1, 2018, this database includes a complete list of the 156 buildings taller than 240 ft, as well as another 24 buildings over 160 ft.
