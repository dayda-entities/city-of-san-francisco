The City Survey was conducted every year from 1996 to 2004, and biennially from 2005 onward. Survey methodology was changed in 2015 from a mail to a phone survey. Comparisons to previous years should be interpreted with caution. Results should be weighted using the variable finweigh in order to adjust for demographic differences between the City Survey sample and San Francisco's population. Please note that survey results were originally reported as unweighted until 2000. From 2000 onward, all City Survey results were reweighted with the exception of data from 1996 and 2011. For ease of use, finweigh has been coded with a value of one for these years. Detailed information on weighting can be found in Survey Process and Methodology section of the 2017 City Survey. A code book is also attached to this dataset under About > Attachments.
