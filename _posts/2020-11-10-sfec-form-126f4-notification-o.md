Each City elective officer who approves a contract that has a total anticipated or actual value of $100,000 or more must file this form with the Ethics Commission within five business days of approval by: (a) the City elective officer, (b) any board on which the City elective officer serves, or (c) the board of any state agency on which an appointee of the City elective officer serves. For more information, see: https://sfethics.org/compliance/city-officers/contract-approval-city-officers.

This dataset includes the affiliates and subcontractors on efiled SFEC Form 126 Notification of Contract Approval and SFEC 126f4 Notification of Contract Approval Filings.

The Affiliates and Subcontractors dataset (https://data.sfgov.org/d/czjm-dat8/) must be joined with the parent dataset (https://data.sfgov.org/d/ite2-5y3b) using the DocuSignID to connect affiliates and subcontractors to the approved contract.
