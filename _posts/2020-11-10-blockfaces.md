A. SUMMARY Blockface geography for the City of San Francisco (coincident with curb lines).

B. METHODOLOGY  Dataset created by multiple analysts over several years; various methodologies employed including manual drawing and use of offset tool and street centerline shapefile. Most recent methodology includes use of  the "blockfaster" tool.

C. UPDATE FREQUENCY  Updated frequently as this dataset is currently in development, as of June 2015. 

D. OTHER CRITICAL INFO  Attributes are in progress and unverified, except for SFPARK_ID.Some blockfaces are drawn only for portions of a given street length, as they were originally intended to show length of street where parking regulations were in effect. Currently being revised (June 2015).
