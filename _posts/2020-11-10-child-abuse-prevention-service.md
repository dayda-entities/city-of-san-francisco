Contains information on child abuse prevention services provided by multiple departments within the City and County of San Francisco, including services run directly by City departments and programs provided by contracted organizations. Information was collected by the Controllerâ€™s Office as a first step in creating a county-wide abuse prevention plan, and includes program descriptions, cost information (where available), and categorizations by service area, protective factor, target audience, and level of prevention. This data was originally collected in FY19 for programs run during FY18. For more information please see the Controller's report at http://openbook.sfgov.org/webreports/details3.aspx?id=2778
