<strong>Annual Inventory Update Notice</strong>
We have updated the inventory with provisional update as of July 1, 2020 based on an initial cleanup and reconciliation of records. DataSF staff are delayed on a full update because of the ongoing COVID-19 response but are working with departments to complete that annual update by end of July.

<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>
The dataset inventory provides a list of data maintained by departments that are candidates for open data publishing or have already been published and is collected in accordance with Chapter 22D of the Administrative Code. The inventory will be used in conjunction with department publishing plans to track progress toward meeting plan goals for each department. Department publishing plans are available at https://datasf.org/publishing/plans

<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>
This dataset is collated through 2 ways:
1. Ongoing updates are made throughout the year to reflect new datasets, this process involves DataSF staff reconciling publishing records after datasets are published
2. Annual bulk updates - departments review their inventories and identify changes and updates and submit those to DataSF for a once a year bulk update - not all departments will have changes or their changes will have been captured over the course of the prior year already as ongoing updates

<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>
The dataset is synced automatically daily, but the underlying data changes manually throughout the year as needed

<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>
<em>Interpreting dates in this dataset</em>
This dataset has 3 dates:
1. Date Added - when the dataset was added to the inventory itself
2. First Published - when the dataset was initially published on the platform
3. Date Created on Platform - the open data portal automatically captures the date the dataset was first created, this is that system generated date

Note that in certain cases we may have published a dataset prior to it being added to the inventory. We do our best to have an accurate accounting of when something was added to this inventory and when it was published. In most cases the inventory addition will happen prior to publishing, but in certain cases it will be published and we will have missed updating the inventory as this is a manual process. 

First published will give an  accounting of when it was actually available on the open data catalog and date added when it was added to this list. 

Date Created on Platform will show when a dataset was initially created. Because datasets are created and re-created as underlying systems changed, this date can be after the first published date if, for example, there was a new dataset published as an improvement over a previous one. Additionally, for new datasets, this date is often prior to the first published date as it is created, reviewed, QA'd and prepared for release.

<em>Companion systems inventory dataset</em>
This is a list of datasets published and unpublished, a companion <a href="https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Inventory-of-citywide-enterprise-systems-of-record/ebux-gcnq">dataset of citywide enterprise systems of record can be accessed online</a> as well.
