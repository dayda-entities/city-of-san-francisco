In accordance with Rules and Regulations Section 1.12 (http://bit.ly/17Oq75y), the Rent Board sets the annual allowable rent increase for rent controlled units. The new rates are effective every year on March 1. The amount is based on 60% of the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for All Urban Consumers in the San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose region for the 12-month period ending October 31, as posted in November by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
