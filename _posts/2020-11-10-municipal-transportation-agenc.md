The Board votes on various items that are captured in the official minutes of each meeting. The map represents the individual items voted on at each board meeting that could be associated with a location either via a block range or intersection. Data are extracted voluntarily by a third-party XTreet (https://xtreet.org) from the PDF minutes. As such, there may be errors or omissions. Also note that data lags minutes as they are transcribed in bulk through a combination of automated and manual processing. The data is provided as is. If you are in need of the accurate accounting of the meetings, please refer to the minutes available at https://www.sfmta.com/about-sfmta/organization/divisions-and-units/board-directors
