In October of 2018, the Board of Supervisors passed and Mayor London N. Breed signed, the Ordinance 243-18 (http://bit.ly/2LSqS3U) to expand the extent to which women are represented  in the public sphere, including within artwork, statues, street names, facilities, parks, and more. The representation of women in City-owned buildings includes buildings, conference rooms, clubhouses, museums, recreation centers, community rooms, auditoriums, terminals, departure halls, 7 staircases, rooms, and other places open to the public. The City Administrator's office was responsible for compiling a list of all city owned buildings named after a man or woman.
