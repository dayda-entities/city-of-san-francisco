Neighborhood boundaries that were defined in 2006 by the Mayor's Office of Neighborhood Services for use with the SF Find tool: http://propertymap.sfplanning.org/?name=sffind. All boundaries are for the purpose of defining general locations of neighborhoods for the SF FIND application only, and as such they are not "hard" lines of demarcation.
