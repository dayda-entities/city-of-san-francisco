Candidates for City elective office and their treasurer/assistant treasurer must complete a training developed by Ethics Commission staff prior to each election in which the candidate will appear on the ballot. An individual who serves as the treasurer for more than one committee is not required to complete a training if that individual has completed such a training within the previous 12 months. This dataset lists candidates and treasurers that have completed the requirement and filed the required SFEC Form 107 since February 26, 2020.
