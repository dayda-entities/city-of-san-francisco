On January 1, 2019, new local laws went into effect that established new requirements for behested payment reports. If behested payments are made at a City officer’s behest, the donors and recipients of such payments may be required to file public disclosures regarding the payments.

A donor must file Form SFEC-3620 if he or she makes a behested payment, or series of behested payments in a single calendar year of $10,000 or more at the behest of an officer. The donor only needs to make this disclosure if the donor is an “interested party” in a proceeding involving the officer that solicited the payment(s).

If a donor has previously filed a Form SFEC-3.620 and during the same calendar year, subsequently makes an additional behested payment at the behest of the same officer, the donor must file an additional For SFEC-3.620 only if the donor has become involved in additional proceedings or made additional contacts that were not disclosed pursuant to section 3.620(a)(1)-(3) on the initial Form SFEC-3.620.

Each row on this table represents the contents of a Form 3620 filed with the Ethics Commission. There is one sub-tables of information on Form 3620, "Payee Information", that is parsed into a separate dataset "SFEC Form 3620 - Donors of Behested Payments Report - Payees" at https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/SFEC-Form-3620-Donors-of-Behested-Payments-Report-/kjzi-iji7. Join this dataset with the sub-table using the DocuSignID.
