On January 1, 2019, new local laws went into effect that established new requirements for behested payment reports. If behested payments are made at a City officer’s behest, the donors and recipients of such payments may be required to file public disclosures regarding the payments.

A donor must file Form SFEC-3620 if he or she makes a behested payment, or series of behested payments in a single calendar year of $10,000 or more at the behest of an officer. The donor only needs to make this disclosure if the donor is an “interested party” in a proceeding involving the officer that solicited the payment(s).

If a donor has previously filed a Form SFEC-3.620 and during the same calendar year, subsequently makes an additional behested payment at the behest of the same officer, the donor must file an additional For SFEC-3.620 only if the donor has become involved in additional proceedings or made additional contacts that were not disclosed pursuant to section 3.620(a)(1)-(3) on the initial Form SFEC-3.620.

Each row on this table represents a payee listed on a subtable of a Form 3620 filed with the Ethics Commission.
