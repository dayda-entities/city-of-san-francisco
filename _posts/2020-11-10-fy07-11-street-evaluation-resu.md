The Controller's Office's City Services Auditor (CSA) Division has worked with the Department of Public Works (DPW) to develop maintenance standards for streets and sidewalks and schedules and inspect for compliance since July 2004. This data file consolidates street and sidewalk inspection results FY07-FY11. Current evaluation results are also available on DataSF; however, they are not comparable to this data set because of changes in methodology.You can access the annual reports at  http://sfcontroller.org/index.aspx?page=49
