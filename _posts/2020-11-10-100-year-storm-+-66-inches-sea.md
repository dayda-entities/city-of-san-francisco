This data originates from San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission's Adapting to Rising Tides Program which performed extensive modelling of expected sea level rise impact across the entire 9-county bay area. This data shows inundation from 66 inches of sea level rise combined with a 100-year storm event (equaling 108 inches of total water level)
