SFEC Form 122 must be filed whenever funds held in a candidate’s campaign account are transferred to another committee established by or on behalf of the candidate. Any contributions being transferred must be attributed to specific contributors using a “first in, first out” (FIFO) or “last in, first out” (LIFO) accounting method.  This dataset contains filings as of March 2, 2020.
