Parking citations issued by the SFMTA. Citation information includes citation, violation and location details which indicate the location and amount of parking citations throughout the city. Citation data is provided by the SFMTA as an export of the citation management system. Citation data is provided daily and the DataSF datasource is updated daily with a 24 hour lag. The geolocation is based on a geocoding process upon load and may not be accurate based on incomplete address data.

For more information on violation codes and descriptions, go <a href="https://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/reports-and-documents/2020/10/fy_2021_fees_and_fines_effective_1.1.21.pdf">here</a>.
