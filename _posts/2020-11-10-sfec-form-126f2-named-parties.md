This dataset contains the names of all contractors and subcontractors that are listed in City contract proposals on SFEC Form 126f2 - Notification of Submission of Proposal filings. 

The Named Parties dataset (https://data.sfgov.org/d/djj2-gvaq/) must be joined with the parent dataset (https://data.sfgov.org/d/pv99-gzft) using the DocuSignID to connect contractors and subcontractors to the proposals.
