The City imposes development impact fees on development projects in order to mitigate the impacts caused by new development on public services, infrastructure and facilities. For example, the burden on the transit system created by a new office building is offset through the payment of an impact fee used to improve MUNI.

Impact Fees are different from, and apply in addition to, application fees, which are used to cover the cost of the Cityâ€™s review of a given proposal. For the most part, impact fees are assessed by the Planning Department and are collected by the Department of Building Inspection (DBI) upon permit issuance.

Some impact fees apply throughout the City to various types of development projects. Others apply only in certain neighborhoods. Another type of impact fee only applies when a builder chooses to pay them in-lieu of meeting a particular Planning Code requirement (e.g. usable open space).
