Under San Francisco Campaign & Governmental Conduct Code Section 3.216(d) elected officers are required to file the Gifts of Travel form before accepting a gift of transportation, lodging, or subsistence for any out-of-state travel that is paid for in part by an individual or entity other than the City and County of San Francisco, another governmental body, or a bona-fide educational institution as defined in section 203 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, or that is paid for by the City in whole or in part with funds donated by any of those individuals or entities. An elected officer who reimburses an individual or entity for a gift of transportation, lodging or subsistence related to out-of-state travel must also file this form within 30 days of the reimbursement. For more information visit www.sfethics.org.
There are two sub-tables of information on the Gifts of Travel form: Accompanying persons and Contributors.  The parent Gifts of Travel form dataset ( https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/Gifts-Of-Travel/snqf-y894 ) must be joined with this Accompanying Persons dataset to view the accompanying persons.  Join the this dataset with the parent dataset using the DocuSignID.
