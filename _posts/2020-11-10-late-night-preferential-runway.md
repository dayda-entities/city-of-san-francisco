The preferred departing runways from 1:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. are 10L/R, 01L/R or 28L/R with an immediate right-turn when safety, weather and traffic permits.  This reduces aircraft noise in residential communities surrounding the airport as over water-departure procedures directs aircraft over the bay. This dataset provides the amount of aircraft late night departures by runways.  The percent of departures are calculated based on the month's total departures.
