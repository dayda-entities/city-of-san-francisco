The City & County of San Francisco has authorized 5 departments to use Unmanned Aircraft Systems (a.k.a. drones) in support of City operations. The authorized departments include: the Controllerâ€™s Office, Fire Department, Public Utilities Commission, Port, and the Recreation and Parks Department.  The Authorized Drone Uses dataset describes the business case each department will employ drones for, and the privacy and public safety protections they will put in place. This data set will be re-evaluated on an annual basis and approved by the Drone Oversight Committee and Committee on Information Technology (COIT). For the policy document see http://sfcoit.org/coit-policies
