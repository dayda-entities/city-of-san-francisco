[Issue 1/31/2018]: The dataset is current as of the end of 2017.  Measure T (November 2016) amended the lobbyist ordinance and changed the lobbyist registration process effective January 1, 2018.  The lobbyist API that populates this dataset must be updated to accommodate the changes.  The Commission plans to address these changes by August 2018.  During the outage, the data can be accessed via the Ethics Commission's lobbyist web site:  https://netfile.com/lobbyistpub/#sfo
++++++++++++
The directory of individual lobbyists contains a list of all lobbyists registered with the San Francisco Ethics Commission.This dataset updates automatically every night.
