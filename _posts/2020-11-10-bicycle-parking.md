A. SUMMARY This dataset contains the locations of bicycle parking racks installed by the SFMTA. The data includes locations that are installed on sidewalks, in on-street bicycle corrals, in city-owned garages, and in parklets. This dataset does not include racks installed on private property or in privately owned garages.

B. METHODOLOGY Locations are associated to an address so they may not reflect there actual placement along the sidewalk. Racks are installed in front of addresses along the sidewalk according to the SFMTA Bicycle Parking: Standards, Guidelines, Recommendations.https://www.sfmta.com/sites/default/files/pdfs/Bicycle_Parking_Guidelines.pdf

C. UPDATE FREQUENCY  The dataset is updated quarterly as racks are continuously installed upon request from the public, businesses, and property owners as well as where the SFMTA sees demand.

D. OTHER CRITICAL INFO  This dataset contains locations for racks installed on the sidewalk, on-street corrals, parklets and parcels, and in city-owned garages. The locations are associated to an address so they may not reflect the exact location installed.
