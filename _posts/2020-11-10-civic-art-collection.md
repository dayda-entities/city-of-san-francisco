<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>
This data set includes all of the publicly-sited works in the Civic Art Collection, which includes historic monuments, murals, and artworks commissioned through the City's Public Art Program. The data set includes the following categories: artist name, title of work, medium, dimensions and location. The location also includes the Cultural Districts and Supervisor District that an artwork resides in. 

<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>
Dataset is exported manually by staff from internal collections database and re-formatted manually by staff.

<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>
Dataset is updated as needed manually by staff.

<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>
Artworks may be located at a specific addresses (traditional building number, street name format) or other locations (City Parks, Piers, SFO, etc.) that don't meet the traditional address format; in these cases, the closest intersection or building address has been used. Please look at the "Location Description" field for the location of the artwork (floor 2, International terminal, Northwest corner, etc.). An individual artwork can consist of a single piece or multiple pieces, this will be reflected in the last part of it's accession number with either a letter or number (i.e. 1904.2.a-b or 1999.22.1-2). A single artwork may have multiple entries, one for each part, or may have a single group entry. Therefore, the number of entries is not equivalent to the number of artworks. Generally, if an artworks' pieces are spread out over a distance, each piece will have an entry and if they are grouped at one location, there will be one group entry. When an artwork spans multiple blocks one end point was chosen for the address/map point. The data column "number_of_districts" refers to how many Cultural Districts a mural is in. If a mural is in more than Cultural Districts, the districts will be listed in the "Cultural_District" column and separated by a semicolon. This is because cultural districts can overlap.
