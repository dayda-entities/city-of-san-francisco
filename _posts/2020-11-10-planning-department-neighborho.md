Boundaries of the Neighborhood Quadrants. These outline the areas of responsibility of the Planning Department's neighborhood planning teams. All building permits and cases are assigned on a geographic basis to the neighborhood planning teams. For example, permits and cases located in the NW neighborhood quadrant are assigned to planners in the NW planning team.
