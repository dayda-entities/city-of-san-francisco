As of December 31st, 2014, there were 28 Permitted Medical Cannabis Dispensaries (MCD) operating in the City and County of San Francisco. SFDPH issues a permit to operate an MCD once approvals are granted by the Department of Building Inspection, Planning Department, Fire Department and The Mayor�۪s Office of Disability. A permit does not overrule state and federal laws regarding cannabis enforcement. For more information and details see attachments.
