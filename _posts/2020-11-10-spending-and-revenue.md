The San Francisco Controller's Office maintains a database of spending and revenue data sourced from it's citywide financial system. This data is presented on the Spending and Revenue report hosted at http://openbook.sfgov.org, and is also available in this dataset in CSV format. New data is added on a weekly basis, and is available from fiscal year 2000 forward.
