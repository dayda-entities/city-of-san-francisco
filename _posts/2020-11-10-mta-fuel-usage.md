The Municipal Transportation Agency (MTA) uses a variety of fuels for its vehicles. This data set provides information on fuel type and the number of gallons used by each MTA facility. Multiple lines of data for the same date indicates each instance of fueling at the specific facility. 

Data is provided annually on a fiscal year basis.
