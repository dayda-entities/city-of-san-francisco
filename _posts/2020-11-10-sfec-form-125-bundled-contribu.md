Under San Francisco Campaign & Governmental Conduct Code Section 1.125, any committee controlled by a City elective officer or candidate for City elective office that receives contributions totaling $5,000 or more that have been bundled by a single individual shall file Form 125 at the same time that they are required to file semi-annual or pre-election campaign statements until the committee is terminated. Committees shall be required to provide this information following the receipt of the final contribution that makes the cumulative total $5,000 or more. For more information visit www.sfethics.org.

Each row on this table represents the contents of a Form 125 filed with the Ethics Commission. There are two sub-tables of information on "Officers" and "Contributions". The sub-tables are parsed into separate datasets: "SFEC Form 125 - Bundled Contributions Disclosure Report - Officers" at https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/SFEC-Form-125-Bundled-Contributions-Disclosure-Rep/x9je-gi3q and "SFEC Form 125 - Bundled Contributions Disclosure Report - Contributions" at https://data.sfgov.org/City-Management-and-Ethics/SFEC-Form-125-Bundled-Contributions-Disclosure-Rep/dzp4-4my5. Join this dataset with the sub-table using the DocuSignID.
