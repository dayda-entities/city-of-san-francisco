The San Francisco Controller's Office maintains a database of purchasing activity from fiscal year 2007 forward. This data is presented on the Purchasing Commodity Data report in CSV format, and represents detailed commodity-level data by purchase order. Additional lines have been added to this dataset to reconcile some document totals from the City's purchasing system to the totals from the City's accounting system in cases when the two amounts are different, which sometimes occurs due to adjustments entered into the accounting system but not the purchasing system. We have removed sensitive information from this data â€“ this is intended to show payments made to entities providing goods and services to the City and County and to protect individuals. For example, we have removed payments to employees (reimbursements, garnishments) and jury members, revenue refunds, payments for judgments and claims, witnesses, relocation and rehousing, and a variety of human services payments. New data is added on a weekly basis.
