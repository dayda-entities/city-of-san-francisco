<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>
This dataset represents the COVID-19 positive confirmed cases by sexual orientation for adult cases (18 or older) where the lab result was reported after April 28th. 

Information on sexual orientation is collected from individuals who are 18 years or older and who opt to provide it during case interviews. The Department of Public Health began asking for this information on April 28, 2020. To gather this information, SFDPH follows their <a href="https://www.sfdph.org/dph/files/PoliciesProcedures/COM9_SexualOrientationGuidelines.pdf">Principles for Collecting, Coding, and Reporting Identity Data: Sexual Orientation Guidelines.</a> 

Read more about <a href="https://www.ebar.com/news/news//295431">California's mandate</a> that all counties report data on sexual orientation and gender identity.

Demographic data (including sexual orientation) are based on information reported from case interviews, laboratories, and providers. This data may not be immediately available for recently reported cases and data will change to reflect as information becomes available. Cumulative counts of 5 or fewer are excluded from the dataset.

<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>
Information on COVID-19 case demographic details (like sexual orientation) is reported from a combination of data sources including electronic and faxed laboratory reports, case interviews, medical providers, and electronic medical record systems. These multiple streams of data are merged, deduplicated, undergo quality assurance and other data verification processes, and are continually updated to maximize completeness of information and reporting on San Francisco residents with COVID-19. Data are prepared by close of business daily for public display.

<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>
Updated daily, dataset uploaded manually by staff

<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>
This data may undercount certain minorities who have faced stigma and discrimination, particularly in medical settings (and therefore may not disclose their gender identity or sexual orientation, for example). 

Missing data (coded here as "missing") may become known over time as more information is gathered.

Sexual Orientation groups resulting in 5 or fewer cumulative cases are dropped for privacy reasons.
