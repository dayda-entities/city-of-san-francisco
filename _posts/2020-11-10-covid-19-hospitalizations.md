<strong>A. SUMMARY</strong>
Count of COVID+ patients admitted to the hospital. Patients who are hospitalized and test positive for COVID-19 may  be admitted to an acute care bed (a regular hospital bed), or an intensive care unit (ICU) bed. This data shows the daily total count of COVID+ patients in these two bed types, and the data reflects totals from all San Francisco Hospitals.

<strong>B. HOW THE DATASET IS CREATED</strong>
Hospital information is based on admission data reported to the San Francisco Department of Public Health.

<strong>C. UPDATE PROCESS</strong>
Updated daily, dataset uploaded manually by staff

<strong>D. HOW TO USE THIS DATASET</strong>
Each record represents how many people were hospitalized on the date recorded in either an ICU bed or acute care bed (shown as Med/Surg under DPHCategory field).

Data shown here include all San Francisco hospitals and will be updated daily with a two-day lag as information is collected and verified. Data may change as more current information becomes available.
