A. SUMMARY Counts of publicly available, on-street parking for each street segment.

B. METHODOLOGY  Counts collected via field surveys from 2008-2014 assuming 17 feet per undemarcated parking space, with a few exceptions. Geoprocessing methodology involved a series of spatial joins between side of street points and each street segment. Full parking census methodology can be found at http://sfpark.org/resources/parking-census-data-context-and-map-april-2014/

C. UPDATE FREQUENCY  Updated infrequently on a schedule TBD

D. OTHER CRITICAL INFO  Users should filter out segments with the value '5555' when aggregating parking census counts. This code is applied to some divided streets where the full parking census count for that street block was aggregated to one side of the divided street.
