SFO conducts a yearly comprehensive survey of our guests to gauge satisfaction with our facilities, services, and amenities. SFO compares results to previous surveys to look for areas of improvement and discover elements of the guest experience that are not satisfactory.

** The 2017 survey and Data Dictionary will be published late Summer, 2017.**
