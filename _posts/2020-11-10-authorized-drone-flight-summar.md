The City & County of San Francisco has authorized 5 departments to use Unmanned Aircraft Systems (a.k.a. drones) in support of City operations. The authorized departments include: the Controllerâ€™s Office, Fire Department, Public Utilities Commission, Port, and the Recreation and Parks Department. The Flight Summary Reports dataset provides information on authorized drone flights by City departments. At the end of the evaluation period, the Drone Oversight Committee and the Committee on Information Technology (COIT) will review all flight summary information to determine the effectiveness of drones in support of City operations and the comprehensiveness of privacy protections. The column Authorized Use in this dataset links to the title in the Authorized Uses dataset (https://data.sfgov.org/d/5e3s-sj56). For the policy document see http://sfcoit.org/coit-policies
