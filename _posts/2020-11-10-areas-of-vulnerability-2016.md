These geographic designations were created to define geographic areas within San Francisco that have a higher density of vulnerable populations. These geographic designations will be used for the Health Care Services Master Plan and DPH's Community Health Needs Assessment.

aov_fin - 1 = YES
aov_fin - 0 = NO

AOV's were defined using 2012-2016 ACS data at the census tract level and the following criteria:

1)      Top 1/3rd for < 200% poverty or < 400% poverty & top 1/3rd for persons of color OR
2)      Top 1/3rd for < 200% poverty or < 400% poverty & top 1/3rd for youth or seniors (65+) OR
3)      Top 1/3rd for < 200% poverty or < 400% poverty & top 1/3rd for 2 other categories (unemployment, high school or less, limited English proficiency persons, linguistically isolated households, or disability)

Tracts that had unstable data for an indicator were automatically given zero credit for that indicator. That is why two language variables are included in the bonus group, because there tend to be a high number of tracts with unstable data for language variables.
