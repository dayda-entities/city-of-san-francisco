Under S.F. Campaign and Governmental Conduct Code 1.128, a candidate who wishes to accept the voluntary expenditure ceiling must file Form SFEC-128 no later than the deadline for filing nomination papers. In a race where at least one candidate has accepted the VEC, all candidates running for office in the same race must file Form SFEC 134(b) within 24 hours of receiving contributions, making expenditures, or having funds that exceed 100 percent of the applicable VEC.
