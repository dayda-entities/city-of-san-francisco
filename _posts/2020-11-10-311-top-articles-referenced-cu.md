This report tracks the name and source/website of the articles referenced for each month shown. Titles with a department name at the end reflect information provided from the department website. The other articles are maintained by SF311 to supplement department data. Articles used by 311 in the course of creating service requests (such as graffiti handling processes) are not included. Metrics of knowledge use from September and October 2017 was inconsistent following the migration to a new system in September 2017. Additionally, the names of articles is different than article names prior to the upgrade.  This dataset is updated monthly.
