Since 2005, the San Francisco Park Evaluation Program (SFPEP) has regularly evaluated and assessed the conditions of all San Francisco civic plazas and squares, mini parks, neighborhood parks and playgrounds, parkways and regional parks. The City Services Auditor division of the Controller’s Office and Recreation & Parks Department (RPD) staff conduct quarterly evaluations and use the results to communicate the condition of San Francisco’s parks to RPD management and park staff, elected officials, and the public, and to improve park conditions by efficient resource allocation and improved maintenance. Starting with fiscal year 2015, the data are collected and maintained in a source system with the Contoller's office, prior historic data will be provided by Rec and Park.
