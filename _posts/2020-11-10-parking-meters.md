A. SUMMARY Location, cap color and other key attributes of parking meters in San Francisco. Does not include operating schedules or rate schedules.

B. METHODOLOGY  Updated via the SFpark data warehouse (Parking Space Inventory) by meter shop staff, with manual updates sourced from SFMTA CAD drawings and MTAB resolutions. 

C. UPDATE FREQUENCY  Updated weekly.

D. OTHER CRITICAL INFO   For active meters only, filter for "Active_Met" = 'M" or "T". Meter operating and rate schedules are more complex and available as separate tables. Key field for joining is the Parking Space ID field.
