[Update 2019-01-08] Data continues not to load but we are now working on developing an ETL off of a new API delivered by Netfile. We are in the discovery phase and do not have an exact ETA but are aiming to have the work complete this quarter.

[Issue 2018-02-21]: We are currently experiencing issues loading updated data from the Netfile source. We are investigating alternative approaches to restoring the automation. Data is not loading after December 2017 for most of the lobbyist activity datasets. During the outage, the data can be accessed via the Ethics Commission's lobbyist web site: https://netfile.com/lobbyistpub/#sfo

+++++++++

The name of each officer of the City and County of San Francisco with whom a lobbyist made a contact.  Contacts of public officials are disclosed by lobbyists registered with the Ethics Commission on a monthly basis.  This dataset updates automatically every night.
