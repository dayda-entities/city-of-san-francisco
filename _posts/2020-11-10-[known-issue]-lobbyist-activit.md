[Update 2019-01-08] Data continues not to load but we are now working on developing an ETL off of a new API delivered by Netfile. We are in the discovery phase and do not have an exact ETA but are aiming to have the work complete this quarter.

[Issue 2018-02-21]: We are currently experiencing issues loading updated data from the Netfile source. We are investigating alternative approaches to restoring the automation. Data is not loading after December 2017 for most of the lobbyist activity datasets. During the outage, the data can be accessed via the Ethics Commission's lobbyist web site: https://netfile.com/lobbyistpub/#sfo

+++++++++

All political contributions of $100 or more made or delivered by the lobbyist or the lobbyist's employer, or made by a client at the behest of the lobbyist or the lobbyist's employer during the reporting period to an officer of the City and County, a candidate for such office, a committee controlled by such officer or candidate, or a committee primarily formed to support or oppose such officer or candidate, or any committee primarily formed to support or oppose a ballot measure to be voted on only in San Francisco. This includes political contributions arranged by the lobbyist, or for which the lobbyist acted as an agent or intermediary.Political contributions are disclosed by lobbyists registered with the Ethics Commission on a monthly basis.  This dataset updates automatically every night.
