[Update 2019-01-08] Data continues not to load but we are now working on developing an ETL off of a new API delivered by Netfile. We are in the discovery phase and do not have an exact ETA but are aiming to have the work complete this quarter.

[Issue 2018-02-21]: We are currently experiencing issues loading updated data from the Netfile source. We are investigating alternative approaches to restoring the automation. Data is not loading after December 2017 for most of the lobbyist activity datasets. During the outage, the data can be accessed via the Ethics Commission's lobbyist web site: https://netfile.com/lobbyistpub/#sfo

"Activity expenses" means any expense incurred or payment made by a lobbyist or a lobbyist's client at the behest of the lobbyist, or arranged by a lobbyist or a lobbyist's client at the behest of the lobbyist, which benefits in whole or in part any: officer of the City and County; candidate for City and County office; aide to a member of the Board of Supervisors; or member of the immediate family or the registered domestic partner of an officer, candidate, or aide to a member of the Board of Supervisors. An expense or payment is not an "activity expense" unless it is incurred or made within three months of a contact with the officer, candidate, or Supervisor's aide who benefits from the expense or payment, or whose immediate family member or registered domestic partner benefits from the expense or payment. "Activity expenses" include honoraria, consulting fees, salaries, and any other thing of value totaling more than $25 in value in a consecutive three-month period, but do not include political contributions.Activity expenses are disclosed by lobbyists registered with the Ethics Commission on a monthly basis.  This dataset updates automatically every night.
