Boundaries of the SF Green Benefit Districts. Data are in a zipped GIS shapefile format. The Green Benefit District program seeks to improve the quality of the public realm – the City’s streets, sidewalks, parks and open spaces – within residential and mixed-use neighborhoods.

A Green Benefit District provides additional maintenance and capital improvements to parks, sidewalks and open spaces within a designated area, in addition to the City’s existing level of baseline services. The services, improvements and administration of Green Benefit Districts are governed by an independent property owners nonprofit association, representative of the neighborhood.
